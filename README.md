# Why should you care about Scoper?

You're a good programmer, a great one.  You follow TDD principles, write excellent unit tests,
and follow IoC principles.  Have you ever wanted to obey the Open/Closed Principal with Unit
tests? Well now you can, with Scoper!

No longer will you need to add constructor arguments to dozens of tests whenever you add a
dependency.  No longer will you need to worry about managing monolithic scope objects for
unit tests to be "simple".  No longer will your SQL database be off limits to reads and writes
for your integration tests.  Just take a quick look below to see how simple your tests could be.

# What is Scoper?

Scoper is a test framework agnostic way to make your tests more manageable.

# Samples

Documentation is coming!

I haven't released a 1.0 version yet, but for now, if you're curious, look in my unit tests project.
Scoper is [eating it's own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)
in my unit tests, so check them out!
