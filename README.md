# Samples

This repo contains NuGet sample packages.

1. `ConsoleApp` - This console application will set the current UI culture to English, Japanese, and Russian, and output a string from `ClassLibrary`

2. `ClassLibrary` - This "localized" class library project exposes string properties for consumption within `ConsoleApp`.

3. `ClassLibrary.nuspec` - The spec for creating the `ClassLibrary` runtime package

4. `ClassLibrary.ja-jp.nuspec` - The spec for creating the `ClassLibrary.ja-jp` satellite package

5. `ClassLibrary.ru-ru.nuspec` - The spec for creating the `ClassLibrary.ru-ru` satellite package

6. `ClassLibrary.Localization.nuspec` - The meta package that pulls in both `ClassLibrary.ja-jp` and `ClassLibrary.ru-ru`

`ConsoleApp` has a NuGet package reference to `ClassLibrary`. By adding a package reference to `ClassLibrary.ja-jp`, `ClassLibrary.ru-ru`, or `ClassLibrary.Localization`, the output of the console application will change to include localized strings.
