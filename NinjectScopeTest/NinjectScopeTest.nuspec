    <description>
        A package for making auto-mocking easier and intuitive with Ninject and Moq
    </description>
    <releaseNotes>
      Making Dependency versions not strict, to fix versioning issues when packages are updated.
      Many features were added to make tests as small as possible.
      Added an auto-mocking feature so that interfaces are mocked automatically without
      specifying them as a property on NinjectTestScope.  Also made Initialize() virtual rather
      than abstract so that a default empty initialize method is not required.
